# Next Steps

With the conclusion of this design validation and study, the next proposed design iteration has two major changes:

- Fully isolating the power path, and
- Changing the DC-DC converter topology to a 150V/10A 4-switch buck-boost converter.

## Power Path Isolation

Currently, the design fails to isolate the power path from the system ground at three major points:

  1. The wide input buck subcircuit used for self-powering the device,
  2. The power monitor subcircuits, and
  3. The active loads.
