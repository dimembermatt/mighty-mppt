With the conclusion of this design validation and study, three major design
changes are proposed for future iterations of this device, meant to improve
safety, reduce BOM cost and complexity, and to improve functional performance:

- Cost, power, and signal optimization
- Full isolation of the power path
- Moving to a 200V/10A buck-boost converter topology
- FPGA hardware logic control of the power path

## Cost, Power, and Signal Optimization

This proposal defines the cost, power, and signal optimization of the system

There is some argument to be made for

- Drop down from F4 to L4 series
- Drop down from 100 kHz - 1 MHz sampling to 100 Hz - 1 kHz sampling
- Switch from SPI to I2C / SMBUS
- 5V iso rail

## Power Path Isolation

This proposal defines the complete isolation of the power path from the system
ground. Currently, the design fails to isolate the power path from the system
ground at three major points:

  1. The wide input buck subcircuit used for self-powering the device,
  2. The gate driver,
  3. The power monitor subcircuits, and
  4. The active loads.

### Self Power 12V Input Subcircuit

The wide input buck subcircuit, used for self-powering the device, takes the
input source and generates a 12V rail on the system ground for powering control
logic that actuates the power path. Currently, it uses a TI SimpleSwitcher power
converter with an input range of 4.2V (effectively >= 12V) to 80V. This is
sufficient for the current design but will not enable future designs with a
higher acceptable input voltage (see section [Buck-Boost Converter](#buck-boost-converter)).
Additionally, the converter is not isolated, which provides a path for
electrical failure on the power path to destroy components on the system ground.

Ideally, the self power circuit would be a fly-buck (trademarked, courtesy of
Texas Instruments) converter, in which a fixed output synchronous buck converter
inductor is a coupled transformer providing a secondary isolated power rail. The
desired fly-buck circuit shall be able to have an operating range of 0 - 200V,
with a primary output rail of 5V and a secondary isolated output rail of 5V,
thus dictating a 1:1 coupling of the transformer. The required output current
for both shall be no more than 1A, for a total of 5W distributed across the
output rails.

The above setup would shift the power regulation power mux protection circuit to
the 5V rails, with a 12V to 5V buck used for the 12V CARPWR or equivalent
connection.

### Gate Driver Subcircuit

Currently, the ADUM4221 gate driver is an isolated device using the 5V system
rail for driving the gate signals. This inherently requires the system ground to
be tied to the power ground, making the subcircuit non-isolated. The proposal
defines a separate module to provide an isolated 5V rail to the gate driver, or
making use of the self powered fly-buck circuit (see section
[Self Power 12V Input Subcircuit](#self-power-12v-input-subcircuit))
to generate the isolated rail without the extra cost and components of an
isolated DC-DC converter.

This design does not remove the use of a bootstrap diode to generate the high
side gate driver signal power rail, however.

### Power Monitoring Subcircuit

The proposal defines replacing the current power monitoring circuit with an
equivalent power monitor IC with isolation rating; among the requirements is the
ability to communicate via SPI or I2C protocol on the system side as well as the
ability to set thresholds for faults like overcurrent, overvoltage,
undervoltage, and so forth, which shall propagate to a an alert pin that can be
used for hardware protection purposes.

### Active Load Subcircuit

Finally, the proposal defines isolating the active load control signal from the
power path. This can easily be done with a digital isolator such as the ISO6720.

## Buck-Boost Converter

This proposal defines the design of a 200V, 10A bidirectional buck-boost
converter. For the current use case (solar car MPPT), the load falls under this
rating, with an operating range of 80-134V. However, the source operating range
is 0-80V, which severely limits the capability of the device in terms of the
full array, which consists of 260 solar cells at 0.721V open circuit for a total
of 161.46V.

With the current setup, at least two MPPTs must be constructed to capture the
entire solar array. This is typically three, since it is recommended that
converters do not run at 100% duty (continuous short across high side switch).
This is either due to (1) conduction losses - not a big deal in the current
design due to the relatively low short circuit current of the solar array or (2)
the inability of the gate driver to keep the high side rail charged through the
bootstrap diode.

With a 200V converter, a future solar car with a similar number of solar cells
in series shall only need one MPPT for operation which saves cost, weight, and
system complexity.

At 200V, we reach the edge of acceptable GaNFETs with a suitable FOM, as the
next set of rated FETs have a VDS of 650V. It has been observed that each VDS
shift (e.g. 150V to 200V to 650V) is a significant step change in FOM. EPC still
has the best listed FOM GaNFETs (if their numbers can be believed), with a
suitable candidate being EPC2207 with a FOM of 5.4. The current rating of 14A is
appropriate for this application and well above the 6.15A short circuit of the
solar array. This is plenty of room for possible parallel configurations of any
future solar array.

Other components shall need to be rerated for 200V with appropriate margin.

Given that the converter now supports a wider input than output, the converter
topology needs to be shifted to a buck-boost topology. A four switch buck-boost
converter allows for reduction in design risk while maintaining simple control
(one side is always shorted high side). Additional complexity in the form of
parallel low RDSON load switches may be added to reduce conduction losses across
the switching fets.

## FPGA Power Path Control

This proposal defines the use of a small footprint, low cost FPGA to (1) replace
the existing hardware protection logic circuitry, (2) offload microcontroller
low level control algorithms, and (3) enhance gate driver actuation capabilities
and converter efficiency via IIM (Independent Input Mode) and ZVS (Zero Voltage
Switching).

The first function is relatively easy, emulating the existing control logic (a
total of six NOT, OR, and AND gates plus a Schmitt trigger buffer) in the FPGA.
Additional functionality can be added, such as delay sequencing logic (e.g. turn
on active loads before disabling load switches), to provide more robust
operation.

The second function takes the above one step further: with a SPI or I2C
interface, the FPGA can directly query the power monitor, compare measurements
against internal thresholds, and directly perform redline triggering. This can
be coupled with the microcontroller to set the thresholds which may be saved in
NVME.

Additionally, the FPGA can take over microcontroller low level control
algorithms; assuming the MCU maintains the high level MPPT algorithm, the FPGA
may do the reference setpoint tuning and PID control (e.g. given some
input/output voltage setpoint, maintain closed loop control to keep
buck-boosting to that value until the next setpoint is provided). This provides
faster feedback than the MCU.

Finally, the third function is to enhance the gate driver control by switching
from MCU PWM to FPGA IIM; the FPGA may be able to provide instantaneous
measurement and feedback of the switching FET VDS profile and perform ZVS
without a fixed dead time. This reduces switching losses, improves switching
characteristics, and augments system performance, which can be particularly
acute at higher power thresholds.

Ideally, the FPGA used to implement this proposal shall have the following
characteristics:

- low footprint, with minimal supporting passives required
- low cost, with easy accessibility from third party distributors
- low power consumption to maintain high system efficiency
- high clock speed (with respect to the previous requirement), capable of
  potentially acting on converter switching frequencies of several hundred kHz
- strong open source toolchain, which enables others to better repair existing
  devices, replace broken devices, and improve upon the firmware design
- sufficient amount of IO and communication peripherals to perform the necessary
  functionality, including:
  - SPI or I2C port(s) to the MCU and/or power monitors
  - 7 I/Os for:
    - Gate Driver IIM (2)
    - Gate Driver Enable/Disable (1)
    - Load Switch Enable/Disable (2)
    - Active Load Enable/Disable (2)
